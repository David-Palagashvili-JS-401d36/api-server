/* TODO: Create a router module for the category data type:

- Create an instance of express.Router() and export it
- Move the appropriate route definitions and route handlers from server.js here
- Redefine the definitions as route definitions (not app definitions)
- Confirm that your server works as before, but now modular
- Begin the conversion from memory data to persistent data â€¦
- Import and initialize the appropriate Mongoose Collection (see bullet points below)
- In your handler methods, rather than change your in-memory data store, call the appropriate model methods
